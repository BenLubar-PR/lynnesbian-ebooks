hey look it's an ebooks bot

python3

install the requirements with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements`

make a bot (probably on bots in space) and follow the target accounts

run `python3 main.py` to login and scrape

run `pyhton3 gen.py` to make a toot

this will toot once every three hours after until it crashes

maybe the code won't be total jenk eventually but \shrug
